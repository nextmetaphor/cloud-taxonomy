      Description: "The AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) makes heterogeneous database migrations predictable. It automatically converts the source database schema and a majority of the database code objects, including views, stored procedures, and functions, to a format compatible with the target database. Any objects that cannot be automatically converted are clearly marked so that they can be manually converted to complete the migration."
